      <p>
        Deepfake technology uses AI to manipulate media, creating realistic but 
        deceptive videos and images. While it has creative applications, it also 
        poses risks such as misinformation, fraud, and identity theft. Educating 
        people about deepfakes helps in identifying manipulated content and preventing 
        misuse. Always verify media sources before believing or sharing content online.
